## _Why_?

Neo4j harnesses the power of connections between data. It provides an _efficient_ and _intuitive_ way of working with data by mimicking how we _naturally_ think about it.  
* **Performance** - extremely scalable, performance remains the same as your data grows
* **Flexibility** - the database can be added to without endangering current functionality

#### Popular Use Cases

* Fraud detection
* Real-time recommendation engines
* Master data management
* Identity and access management
* Related search

## _What_?

> #### "A highly scalable native graph database that leverages data relationships as first-class entities"

The Neo4j graph consists of **_nodes_** (_objects in the graph_) and **_edges_** (_relationships between objects_) both of which you can query with **Cypher** (_Neo4j's query language_).

_Both nodes and edges can have name-value properties attached to them that can be used to give a more declarative description of what they are._
